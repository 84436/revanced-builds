# My personal ReVanced builds

- Original base APK and splits from APKMirror (and APKCombo if the bundles from APKMirror are missing some splits), merged using [APKEditor](https://github.com/REAndroid/APKEditor), and patched using [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli).
- Target APK configuration (only guaranteed for YouTube, best-effort for other apps):
    - ABIs: `arm64-v8a`
    - Languages: `en` (English), `vi` (Vietnamese)
    - Resource resolutions: `xhdpi` (~320 dpi), `xxhdpi` (~480 dpi)
- Included/enabled patches are listed in `*.revanced.py` in each build.

## Where are the builds?

[In the Releases section](https://github.com/84436/revanced-builds/releases).

## Should I trust you/your builds?

No, unless you personally know me. If you can learn how to use ReVanced CLI (Kotlin app, recommended) or ReVanced Manager (Android app), please do so.
