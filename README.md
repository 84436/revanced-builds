# My personal YouTube ReVanced builds

Exactly what it says on the tin.

- Original base APK and splits from [APKMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/), merged using [APKEditor](https://github.com/REAndroid/APKEditor), and patched using [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli).
- Supported ABIs: `arm64-v8a`
- Supported languages: `en` (English), `vi` (Vietnamese)
- Supported resource resolutions: `xhdpi` (~320 dpi), `xxhdpi` (~480 dpi)
- Included/enabled patches are listed in `youtube-*-revanced.py` in each build.

## Where are the builds?

[In the Releases section](https://github.com/84436/revanced-youtube-builds/releases).

## Should I trust you/your builds?

No, unless you personally know me. If you can learn how to use ReVanced CLI (Kotlin app, recommended) or ReVanced Manager (Android app), please do so.
